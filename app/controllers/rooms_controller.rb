# The reservations action finds the room that the user wants to reserve and initializes a new Reservation instance variable. It then renders the reservations.html.erb view, which displays a form for creating a new reservation.

#The create_reservation action finds the room that the user wants to reserve, builds a new Reservation instance based on the form parameters, sets the user_id attribute to the current user's ID, and then tries to save the reservation to the database. If the reservation is successfully saved, the user is redirected to the show action for the reservation. Otherwise, the reservations.html.erb view is rendered again.
